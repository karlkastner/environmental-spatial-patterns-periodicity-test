%% 1) that the critical values for the confidence levels a1 suggested by
%%    Renshaw and Ford 1984 result in the misidentification of significant frequency
%%    components, in nearly all patterns consisting of white noise,
%%    i.e. P(p>a1) ~ 1 >> a1
%%
%% 2) that the amended confidence interval with level an = a1/nt,
%%    correctly results in the identification of significant components in only
%%    P(p>an) = a1 of all patterns
